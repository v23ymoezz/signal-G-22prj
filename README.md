### Georgia 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database Analysis
## Introduction
This repository contains code for analyzing the Georgia 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database using machine learning techniques. The code focuses on building an LSTM-based deep learning model to classify ECG signals into different disease categories.

## Code Description
The provided code snippet performs the following tasks:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: It loads ECG data from the Georgia 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database, preprocesses the data, and prepares it for model training.

Model Architecture: The code defines an LSTM-based neural network architecture using TensorFlow/Keras for binary classification of ECG signals.

Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the prepared data and evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix.

Visualization: The code generates visualizations, including ROC curves and confusion matrices, to assess model performance.

## Instructions
To use the code:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with necessary dependencies such as TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Set the directory to the location of the Georgia 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database.

Execute the code in a Python environment capable of running deep learning models.
